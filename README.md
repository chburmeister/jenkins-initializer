small collection of tools to bootstrap a jenkins instance from scratch

Usage of complete script
------------------------
* create your own copy of settings.conf by copying the file settings.conf.example
* look through the scripts to make sure, you understand it :-)
* define properties in src/scripts/run.sh to your needs
* cd ./src/scripts/ && ./run.sh 

Usage of groovy scripts
